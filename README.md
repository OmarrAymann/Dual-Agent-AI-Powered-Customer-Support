# Dual-Agent AI-Powered Customer Support  
**Cloud Agent (Copilot Studio) + On-Premise Agent Integration**

This project implements a hybrid AI-powered customer support system using two coordinated agents:

- A **cloud-based agent** built and deployed with **Microsoft Copilot Studio**
- A **local agent** deployed within internal infrastructure using **containerized LLMs**

The system enables real-time customer interaction, dynamic task execution, and secure access to business logic via live API endpoints. Itâ€™s designed for use cases requiring data residency, regulatory compliance, and flexible AI deployment in financial or enterprise environments.
