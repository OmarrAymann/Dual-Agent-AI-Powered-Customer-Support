# Dual-Agent-AI-Powered-Customer-Support
This project implements a dual-agent AI customer support system combining cloud-based capabilities via Microsoft Copilot Studio with an on-premise LLM-powered agent. Both agents are integrated into a unified customer portal to handle user queries, execute dynamic tasks, and enforce business logic using real-time API communication.
